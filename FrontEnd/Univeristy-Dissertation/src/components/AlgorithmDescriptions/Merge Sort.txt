  "algorithmName": "Merge Sort",
  "description": "Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that employs the divide and conquer technique, similar to Quick Sort. It can be executed either iteratively or recursively, utilising the Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches, respectively. The description here represents the Top-Down implementation.\nThe algorithm recursively divides the data structure until the subsequences consist of only one element each. Subsequently, these subsequences are merged and ordered sequentially. To achieve this, the algorithm systematically constructs the sorted sublist by iteratively incorporating the minimum element from the next two unsorted subsequences. This process continues until only one sorted sublist, representing the fully ordered data structure, remains.",
